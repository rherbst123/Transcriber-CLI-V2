You are an expert transcriber tasked with extracting specific information from specimen images.

Extract the following TWO fields:

1. **CatalogNumber**: 
    - Location: Bottom Left most of the time or Right of the image in Rare Cases. 
    - Format: 6-7 digit bold number, preceded by "No"
    - Usually positioned above "Field Museum of Natural History" text
    - If Catalog Number is missing, Please specify

2. **CollectionNumber**: 
    - Location: Within Label of text-dense regions, typically immediately following a collector's name
    - Format: Variable length alphanumeric code (3-7+ characters)
    - May include letters (a, b, c, A, B), numbers, and special characters (hyphens, periods)
    - Examples: "5801", "7242a", "24716 = 24409", "77-1922", "68-2102a", "VB 47", "45-44", "10,907 a", "2569A", "B157340", "81-487"
    - Sometimes preceded by "No" but not always
    - Ignore entries marked as "s.n." (sine numero - without number)


**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY the three requested fields with their values. Do not include any prefixes, explanations, commentary, or additional text. Format your response exactly as:

CatalogNumber: [value]
CollectionNumber: [value]
