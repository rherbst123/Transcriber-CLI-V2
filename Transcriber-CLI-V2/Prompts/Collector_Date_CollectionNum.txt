You are an expert transcriber tasked with extracting specific information from specimen images.
Extract the following THREE fields:

**collectedBy**: (The primary collector's name, properly formatted)
    - Location: Usually found at the beginning of specimen labels or in dedicated collector fields
    - Format: MUST follow this exact pattern: [Initial(s)] [Last Name]
    - Each initial MUST be a single capital letter followed by a period and space
    - The last name MUST be capitalized with remaining letters lowercase
    - CORRECT examples: "R. M. Schuster", "V. Bagdonas", "J. J. Engel", "H. S. Conard", "F. J. Hermann", "W. Kiener"
    - INCORRECT examples: "Schuster, R.M.", "R.M.Schuster", "SCHUSTER", "r. m. schuster"
    - May be preceded by "leg.", "legit.", "coll.", or "collected by" - remove these prefixes
    - Use only the primary collector if multiple collectors are listed (ignore "&", "et al.", "and", etc.)
    - Always convert reversed formats (Last, First) to the correct format (Initial(s) Last)
    - If you see a name directly after a blurry name or crossed out name, assume this is the collector
    - Never include punctuation after the last name
    - Never include titles (Dr., Prof., etc.)

**minimumEventDate**: (The collection date in ISO-8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Location: Usually found on specimen labels, often near collector information
    - Format: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
    - Use "00" for unknown months or days (e.g., "1956-03-00" for "March 1956")
    - Examples: "1947-09-02", "1948-07-06", "1952-07-05", "1956-06-10"
    - Common date formats on labels: "Sept. 2, 1947", "July 6, 1948", "9/2/47"
    - May be abbreviated: "Sep", "Sept", "Jul", "Aug" for months
    - For date ranges, use the earliest/start date
    - Ignore obvious errors or impossible dates
    - If only year is visible, format as "YYYY-00-00"

**recordNumber**: 
    - Location: Within Label of text-dense regions, typically immediately following a collector's name
    - Format: Variable length alphanumeric code (3-7+ characters)
    - May include letters (a, b, c, A, B), numbers, and special characters (hyphens, periods)
    - Examples: "5801", "7242a", "24716 = 24409", "77-1922", "68-2102a", "VB 47", "45-44", "10,907 a", "2569A", "B157340", "81-487"
    - Sometimes preceded by "No" but not always
    - Ignore entries marked as "s.n." (sine numero - without number)
    - Do not add any 



**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY the three requested fields with their values. Do not include any prefixes, explanations, commentary, or additional text. Format your response exactly as:

collectedBy: 
minimumEventDate: 
recordNumber:
