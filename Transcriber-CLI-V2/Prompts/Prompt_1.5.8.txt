You are an expert transcriber tasked with extracting specific information from herbarium specimen labels.
Please transcribe and expand all details from this herbarium label. Do not include any full stops. If there is no information present for a field insert N/A. If in a language other than English, do not translate. If unsure at all, state "unsure and check". Create a single list of these fields, consolidate all information into this single list.

Please Do NOT add any prefixes to the fields or number the fields. Only the field names and their information should be returned.
Please Do NOT add a header for the response. This includes a summary or any other information.

**verbatimCollectors**: (The collectors as you see it on the label, this might be one collector, a string of collectors, that collected the sample)
    - Location: Usually found at the beginning of specimen labels or in dedicated collector fields
    - Format: Exactly as appearing on label with no modifications
    - Examples: "leg. R. M. Schuster", "collected by V. Bagdonas & J. Smith", "legit. H. S. Conard", "R. M. Schuster", "Schuster, R.M. & Smith, J."
    - May be preceded by "leg.", "legit.", "coll.", or "collected by"
    - Transcribe precisely as written including any abbreviations or formatting
    - CRITICAL: This field must ALWAYS be populated if collectedBy has a value
    - This is the raw, unformatted version of the collector information before processing for collectedBy
    - Include ALL text related to collectors, even if poorly formatted or abbreviated

**collectedBy**: (The primary collector's name, properly formatted)
    - Location: Usually found at the beginning of specimen labels or in dedicated collector fields
    - Format: MUST follow this exact pattern: [Initial(s)] [Last Name]
    - Each initial MUST be a single capital letter followed by a period and space
    - The last name MUST be capitalized with remaining letters lowercase
    - CORRECT examples: "R. M. Schuster", "V. Bagdonas", "J. J. Engel", "H. S. Conard", "F. J. Hermann", "W. Kiener"
    - INCORRECT examples: "Schuster, R.M.", "R.M.Schuster", "SCHUSTER", "r. m. schuster"
    - May be preceded by "leg.", "legit.", "coll.", or "collected by" - remove these prefixes
    - Use only the primary collector if multiple collectors are listed (ignore "&", "et al.", "and", etc.)
    - Always convert reversed formats (Last, First) to the correct format (Initial(s) Last)
    - If you see a name directly after a blurry name or crossed out name, assume this is the collector
    - Never include punctuation after the last name
    - Never include titles (Dr., Prof., etc.)

**secondaryCollectors**: (These are collectors listed after the first, only capitalize names)
    - Location: Found after the primary collector name
    - Format: Last name with abbreviated first/middle initials, separated by spaces
    - Examples: "J. Smith | M. A. Wilson", "B. C. Tan"
    - Separate multiple collectors by a pipe (|)
    - Maintain proper spacing between initials and last name
    - Capitalize only the first letter of the last name and initials

**recordNumber**: (An identifier given to the specimen at the time it was recorded)
    - Location: Within label text-dense regions, typically immediately following a collector's name

    - May include letters, numbers, and special characters (hyphens, periods)
    - Sometimes preceded by "No" but not always
    - CRITICAL: This is NOT a person's name
    - Do NOT confuse this with collector names or initials
    - Do NOT format this like collectedBy field
    - If not present put "s.n."

**verbatimEventDate**: (The verbatim date field exactly as shown on the label)
    - Location: Usually found on specimen labels, often near collector information
    - Format: Precisely as appearing on label with no corrections
    - Examples: "Sept. 2, 1947", "July 6, 1948", "9/2/47", "March 1956"
    - If not present put "s.d."

**minimumEventDate**: (The collection date in ISO-8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Location: Usually found on specimen labels, often near collector information
    - Format: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
    - Use "00" for unknown months or days (e.g., "1956-03-00" for "March 1956")
    - Examples: "1947-09-02", "1948-07-06", "1952-07-05", "1956-06-10"
    - For date ranges, use the earliest/start date
    - If only year is visible, format as "YYYY-00-00"

**maximumEventDate**: (Used for the last date in a range)
    - Format: Convert to YYYY-MM-DD format
    - Use "00" for unknown months or days
    - Examples: "1956-03-31" for end of March 1956 range
    - If there is no range, insert N/A
    - Do not repeat the minimumEventDate
